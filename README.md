## Project Description
Our mood greatly impacts our decision-making skills by influencing the type of information we attend to and how we process it. According to research, individuals with depression tend to have negative responses to losses, leading them to make risky decisions. In contrast, those with anxiety are likely to make less risky decisions as they need certainty of outcomes to gain the sense of security.

Presently, there is a wide array of research focusing on the important role of emotions in decision making and how the change in our mental processes and logic impact our critical-thinking skills. However, most of this research is based on artificial mood-manipulation strategies in controlled laboratory settings. This makes it difficult for the results from these studies to ascertain that this reflects our true decision-making capabilities. This brings us to the importance of our app, where we are able to monitor decision-making skills in response to day-to-day fluctuations in a real-time manner using a gamified approach.
