# Reworad Processing App
Welcome to the repository for the Reward Processing App. Our application is developed using Flutte(dart), which allows us to support both iOS and Android platforms. We use a cloud-based database, Firebase, to store all relevant data, and everything related to the database is also included in this repository.


## Feature
Our code is divided into two main sections:

### Questionnaire:

This section includes the following pages:

- Splash screen
- Welcome page
- Prolific ID page
- Consent page
- 16-page questionnaire
- Two questionnaires after the game
- Finish page
### Game
This section includes the following pages:

- Game instruction page
- Game (game_map & game_map2)

We believe that our application is designed to provide a user-friendly experience, and we aim to continuously improve it in future updates.
